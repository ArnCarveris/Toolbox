	by Ink Studios Ltd.
	
# Description

The Toolbox is powered by the CryENGINE renderer, and does not rely on external GUI solutions.
	
### Documentation & Info
More Toolbox documentation and information can be found at http://docs.inkdev.net/display/Toolbox.

#### Source directory structure 
Our Visual Studio projects have been set up to expect all contents to be placed inside a folder within the Code folder shipped with the CryENGINE Free SDK.

Example:
C:\CryENGINE\Code\Toolbox

Using another folder structure is up to the developer, but will require customization in order for reference and output locations to be correct.
